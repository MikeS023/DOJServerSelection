# DOJServerSelection

DOJServerSelection is an application that was built by myself, with help from Alex M. The sole purpose of this application is to give an easier way to connect to the DOJRP FiveM Servers. There was a prior version that does a similar thing is, my "DoJRP Server Quick Join Shortcuts." This was a desktop shortcut icon-based system. It was clunky and far less appealing.

# Installation
Automatic: Download the installer and run the installer to a location of your choice. Remember the path. Then, open the created folder, right-click on "main.exe" and create a shortcut. You can move this to your desktop or a place of your choosing.

Manual: Download the ".zip" file and extract it to a place of your choosing. Inside you will find a "main.exe" file. Right-click on this and create a shortcut. You can move this to your desktop or a place of your choosing. 

# Usage
Open the shortcut you created, a menu will display asking for your "FiveM.exe" location. Click the blue select box, and locate your "FiveM.exe." If you do not do this properly, this application will not work.

In the upper right-hand corner, you will find a "Return to Home" button. Click that and it will bring you to the main screen. From here you can see each "public" DOJ Server and its player count.

Left-click on a server of your choice and it will automatically open your FiveM and connect you to the DOJRP Server.Â 

# Disclaimer
If you are not a DOJRP Member, you will be able to connect, however, you will not get past the loading screen. (This is the default structure) I will also continue to update this application further!

# Further Insight
If you require further insight before downloading, please change the Branch selector to "Files." (Below the "<> Code" button)
